## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Tags instead of groups (organizational, balances global per person)
- Beautiful UX as core value (primary differentiator vs Splitwise)
- Hybrid account model (low-friction onboarding, claim accounts later)
- Offline-first architecture (essential for travel use case)
- Next.js + Supabase + Tailwind + Framer Motion stack

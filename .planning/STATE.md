**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: Phase 7 (parallel execution, 3 waves)
- Trend: Parallel execution with dependency analysis enables ~5x faster than sequential
- Phase 7: 3 waves (2+2+1) completed in ~17 min wall-clock time

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Tags instead of groups (organizational, balances global per person)
- Beautiful UX as core value (primary differentiator vs Splitwise)
- Hybrid account model (low-friction onboarding, claim accounts later)
- Offline-first architecture (essential for travel use case)
- Next.js + Supabase + Tailwind + Framer Motion stack
